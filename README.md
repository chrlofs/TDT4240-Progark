# TDT4240-Progark

## Installation
Ensure you have CocoaPods installed by running `pod`. If you don't, install with:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
``` 

Go to the project Directory (TDT4240-Progark/Drop) and run `pod install`

If you have XCode open, close it and open the project using the `.xcworkspace` rather than the `.xcodeproj`. Now you should be able to build the project (⌘+⇧B)
